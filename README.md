# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Environment Setup (Supabase)

1. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in your Supabase values (these are safe for client use):

   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` â€“ Project URL from Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` â€“ anon public key from Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API

3. Start the app (Expo automatically loads `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables):

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Notes:

- Do not put your Postgres connection string or service role key in the app. Those are server-side secrets.
- Storage bucket used by this app: `my-plate-bucket`. Ensure it exists and is public or has appropriate read policy.
- Example table used by the Add Recipe page: `test_recipes` with columns `recipe_name`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, `photo_url`.
